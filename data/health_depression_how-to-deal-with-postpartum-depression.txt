The period after you have your baby can be filled with countless emotions, including sadness. If your feelings of sadness become severe and start to interfere with your everyday life, you may be experiencing postpartum depression (PPD).

Symptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) usually start within a few weeks of delivery, though they may develop up to 6 months afterward. They may include changes in mood, trouble bonding with your baby, and difficulty thinking or making decisions.

If you feel like you may be depressed, you aren’t alone. Many new parents experience depression after giving birth.

The most effective way to diagnose and treat PPD is by visiting your doctor. They can evaluate your symptoms and devise the best treatment plan for you. You may benefit from psychotherapy, antidepressants, or some combination of both.

There are also things you can do at home to help cope with everyday life. Keep reading for more on how to manage PPD.



## 1. Exercise when you can

Researchershave found that exercise is effective at reducing some of the symptoms of PPD. One review examined five studies and 6,141 participants and found that exercise was a statistically significant way to help improve postpartum depression. A2024 studyfound that walking was an effective way to reduce depression and anxiety.

Can’t fit in a long exercise session? Try working out for 10 minutes a few times during the day.



## 2. Maintain a healthy diet

Healthy eating alone won’t cure PPD. Still, getting into the habit of eating nutritious foods can help you feel better and give your body the nutrients you need.

Try planning the week’s meals on the weekend and even preparing healthy snacks ahead of time. Think whole foods that are easy to grab on the go, such as chopped carrots and cubed cheese or apple slices and peanut butter.



## 3. Create time for yourself

You may feel stuck on the couch breastfeeding. Maybe you’re feeling overwhelmed by work, household responsibilities, or your older children. Instead of managing these stresses alone, reach out for help. Take up your mother-in-law on her offer of free babysitting. Let your partner or another trusted adult take the baby for an hour or 2.

You may find it helpful to schedule some dedicated “me time” once a week. Even if you can only get out of the house between nursing sessions, you can use this time to decompress. Go on a walk, take a nap, go to a movie, or do some yoga and meditation.



## 4. Make time to rest

You’ve probably been told to “sleep when the baby sleeps.” This advice may get annoying after a while, but it’s rooted in science. A2023 survey studyof 1,409 postpartum women found that of these women, those with higher levels of fatigue, poor sleep quality, and low resilience levels were at the greatest risk of developing PPD.

In the early days, your baby likely isn’t sleeping through the night. You may find it helpful to take naps or go to bed early. If you’re breastfeeding, consider pumping a bottle so your partner can take care of an overnight feeding or two.



## 5. Focus on fish oils

Now is also a good time to beef up your intake of fatty acids.In a2019 Japanese study, researchers found that women with higher fish consumption and higher n-3 PUFA intake had a reduced risk of postpartum depression 6months after delivery.

Seafood is an excellent dietary source of fatty acids. If you’re a vegetarian, flaxseed oil is another great source. You can also find supplements at your local grocery store.



## 6. Examine your breastfeeding

A  suggests that breastfeeding may reduce your risk of developing PPD. In this study, researchers found that breastfeeding was associated with a 14% lower risk risk of PPD.

That being said, there are some cases where women develop depression symptoms while nursing. This condition is calledDysmorphic Milk Ejection Reflex, or D-MER. With D-MER, you might experience sudden feelings of sadness, agitation, or anger that last several minutes after your milk lets down.

In the end, choose the feeding method that feels right to you.



## 7. Resist isolation

The days may blend together, making you feel isolated at times. Astudy from 2022suggests that getting support from other new moms may help relieve some symptoms of PPD. Researchers found that new moms who received peer support even once a week for 3 months reported improvements in their PPD symptoms.

## When to see your doctor

Although many women experience the “baby blues” in the first several weeks following delivery, PPD is marked by deeper and longer-lasting feelings of sadness and agitation. These feelings can get worse and become chronic depression without medical help.

It’s a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor if you notice feelings of depression after birth, especially if they don’t fade after a couple of weeks or get worse with time. Few women ever seek treatment for their symptoms, despite the importance of treatment. Your doctor can point you in the right direction to get the support you need.



## Traditional treatments

Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for PPD. It involves speaking with a mental health professional about your thoughts and feelings. In your sessions, you can work on ways to cope and solve problems. You can also set goals and find ways to deal with different situations so that you feel better and more in control.

In more severe cases, your doctor may also suggest antidepressants. These medications may enter your breast milk but are generally considered safe for women who breastfeed. If you have any concerns about this, speak with your doctor. They can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks.



## Developing a support network

You may find comfort in confiding in a close friend or family member. If you don’t want to share your feelings with people you know, there are other places you can turn to for support.

You can:

- Call your OB-GYN, midwife, or another healthcare professional.
- If you participate in a faith community, speak with a leader.
- Find a nearby support group for parents with PPD.
- Join an online forum or group for parents with PPD likePostpartum Progress.
- Call the anonymous PSI postpartum depression hotline at 800-944-4773.


## Outlook

PPD is treatable. Many women see their symptoms improve within 6 months.

Call your doctor immediately if you feel disoriented or confused, have obsessive thoughts about your baby, feel paranoid, or experience hallucinations. These are signs of a more severe condition called postpartum psychosis.

If you’re having thoughts of suicide or thoughts about harming your baby, call your local emergency services.
