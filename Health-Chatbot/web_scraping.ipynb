       "\"Postpartum depression can affect anyone. Here are some tips for coping with it.\\n\\nThe birth of a baby can bring a lot of change to someone’s life. Some of these changes are expected, like lots of dirty diapers, new feeding schedules, and sleep deprivation.\\n\\nBut some changes are less expected — such as those that affect your mental and emotional health, likepostpartum depression (PPD).\\n\\nPPD is a form ofmajor depressive disorder (MDD)that develops in a parent in the year following the birth of their child. Many factors maycause postpartum depression.\\n\\n“It’s similar to major depression in that the main symptoms are feeling depressed and disinterested,” explains Kristin Calverley, a licensed psychologist in Texas certified in perinatal mental health and owner ofInner Balance Psychological Services.\\n\\nOther symptoms you might experience include, but aren’t limited, to:\\n\\nIf you’re experiencing any of these symptoms for several days or weeks on end, you might be experiencing PPD. Whether or not you’re the parent who gave birth to your baby, PPD can affect you.\\n\\nBut there are strategies that can help you manage your symptoms. Consider the following tips to help you cope:\\n\\n\\n\\n## Try to give yourself grace\\n\\n“Recognize that your experience is valid, and it is not your fault that you are ‘struggling’,” saysKara Kushnir, a New Jersey licensed clinical social worker trained in perinatal and postpartum mental health.\\n\\nYou’re not a bad parent because you were diagnosed with PPD — and things will get better with treatment and time. PPD can affect both the birthing parent and thenon-birthing parent.\\n\\nAccording to a 2021 study, roughly1 in 7women experience PPD.\\n\\nA 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis also suggests that somewhere between1.2% and 25.5%of men develop paternal postpartum disorder.\\n\\nLike most forms of depression, researchers aren’t exactly sure whatcauses PPD. Instead, it appears that several risk factors contribute to it, including:\\n\\nIn other words, saysSandy J. Green, a certified lactation counselor, postpartum doula, and the founder of Taking Care of Mama, “it is likely caused by various factors — none of which is your fault.”\\n\\n\\n\\n## Try to prioritize sleep where and when you can\\n\\nIt might sound cliche to “sleep when the baby sleeps” but the truth is, sleep is incredibly important to your mental health. So when and if you can sleep, you should. (The laundry or dirty dishes can wait.)\\n\\nAccording to a2018 study, sleep deprivation is believed to increase the chances of developing PPD.\\n\\nA large2016 studyindicated that both parents are more likely to have depressive symptoms if the birthing parent sleeps poorly.\\n\\nAnother2016 studyinvolving 360 women in Ardabil, Iran suggested that women that didn’t sleep well were 3 times more likely to experience PPD compared to postpartum women with good sleep quality.\\n\\nA large2015 studyalso found that suicidal ideation increased in women with PPD that were sleep-deprived.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Consider making time to exercise\\n\\nGoing to the gym may seem like the last thing you want to do when there is a newborn at home to take care of, but making time to get your body moving — even if it’s just a short walk around the park — can be helpful.\\n\\n“Exercise allows you to release endorphins, establish routine, and mentally disengage in a way that is both productive and healthy,” saysNicholas Hardy, a psychotherapist in Houston.\\n\\nOf course, if you’re the birthing parent, make sure you allow your body time to heal before engaging in strenuousexercise.\\n\\nConsider talking with your doctor about what activities are safe for you to do within the first 3 months after bringing the baby home.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Try to prioritize your hygiene\\n\\nCaring for a newborn can be all-consuming between the round-the-clock feedings, dirty diapers, and trying to fit naps in. So it’s easy to put off taking a shower, washing your hair, brushing your teeth, or even scrubbing your face.\\n\\nWhen our hygiene goes unnoticed, though, it can impact our self-esteem and further isolate us from our support networks because we don’t want others to see us not looking our best.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Consider carving out time for other self-care\\n\\nIt’s okay to take a short break tomeditate, read a book, or even schedule a massage.\\n\\nYou may be surprised just how much these short moments of self-care might help lessen your symptoms of depression.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Do one chore or outside activity\\n\\nEven if you just run to the corner bakery for a muffin, leaving the house for a little while each day may decrease your feelings of loneliness or isolation.\\n\\nPlus, it can help break the repetitive cycle of caring for your newborn by helping you feel like you’re accomplishing at least one thing on your to-do list each day.\\n\\nTry to avoid overloading yourself with tasks to accomplish. It might just make you feel more anxious or overwhelmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Eat nourishing meals when you’re able\\n\\nEating healthfully is important whether you’re the birthing parent and are breastfeeding, you’re feeding your baby formula, or you’re the non-birthing parent.\\n\\nA large2021 studyindicated that diets lacking vegetables and food variety were associated with PPD in Chinese lactating women.\\n\\nEating nutritious foods can help you feel better and give your body the nutrients you need while caring for your baby and yourself.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Try talking to those you trust about what you’re going through\\n\\n“It is important to identify individuals and communities that allow you to openly express your feelings,” says Hardy. “When we suppress our emotions, [they] build up and create friction in other areas of our lives.”\\n\\nFor example, consider talking to your partner, family, or friends. Speaking with loved ones may help them better understand what you’re going through, and how they can better support you.\\n\\n\\n\\n## It’s OK to ask for help\\n\\nIn addition to telling others what you’re going through, consider asking people you trust for help. Support from those you trust can help you find the time for the other things, such as more sleep andself-care.\\n\\nConsider using this time to explore what you may need to help you relax and feel better.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Consider joining a support group\\n\\nIf you don’t feel like you can truly talk to your family or friends about what you’re going through — or don’t feel like they can give you the kind of support you need — consider reaching out to a therapist or support group.\\n\\nFor example, Calverley says, “there are many free support groups both online and throughout the country that cater specifically to moms who are ‘struggling.'”\\n\\nThere are also support groups for non-birthing parents where you can meet and talk with parents going through similar experiences.\\n\\nIf you’re not sure where to find a group, check outpostpartum support international, which offers a directory of support groups that can be helpful.\\n\\n“When I was a new father, I got a lot more out of talking to men that I admired as good fathers about their early adventures of being a dad,” says Nolan Davis, licensed marriage and family therapist atThriveworks in Charlotte, North Carolina.\\n\\n“Those stories gave me a lot of encouragement that not only can I do this, but that any ‘mistakes’ I make along the way are likely not going to ruin my child for the rest of their life.”\\n\\n“Knowing that I had within me everything I needed to be a good dad gave me the confidence to embrace my role as a father.”\\n\\n\\n\\n## Consider seeking professional support\\n\\n“The biggest tip I have for new mothers is not to wait to get help,” says Green. “Online therapy is an excellent option as it’s affordable and very convenient.”\\n\\nSome parents, particularly those who are breastfeeding or chestfeeding, sometimes delay treatment out of fear that treatment might involve medication that isn’t safe if passed to the baby through breastmilk.\\n\\nHowever, Green continues, “many antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications are safe while breastfeeding [so] there’s no shame in talking to your doctor about these medications, in conjunction with therapy, if you’re suffering.”\\n\\nSome people also benefit fromcouples therapy, particularly if their diagnosis has affected their relationship with their partner.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nLife with PPD can feel difficult but remember it doesn’t have to last forever — or take over your life. With treatment and self-care, you can manage your symptoms and begin to feel better.\\n\\nPPD can be diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional or doctor with clinical questioning and theEdinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.\\n\\nTreatment may involve talk therapy, antidepressants, or a combination of both.\\n\\nThere are also several helpful books that you might want to consider reading, including:\\n\\n\""

       "'The period after you have your baby can be filled with countless emotions, including sadness. If your feelings of sadness become severe and start to interfere with your everyday life, you may be experiencing postpartum depression (PPD).\\n\\nSymptoms of postpartum depression (PPD) usually start within a few weeks of delivery, though they may develop up to 6 months afterward. They may include changes in mood, trouble bonding with your baby, and difficulty thinking or making decisions.\\n\\nIf you feel like you may be depressed, you aren’t alone. Many new parents experience depression after giving birth.\\n\\nThe most effective way to diagnose and treat PPD is by visiting your doctor. They can evaluate your symptoms and devise the best treatment plan for you. You may benefit from psychotherapy, antidepressants, or some combination of both.\\n\\nThere are also things you can do at home to help cope with everyday life. Keep reading for more on how to manage PPD.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 1. Exercise when you can\\n\\nResearchershave found that exercise is effective at reducing some of the symptoms of PPD. One review examined five studies and 6,141 participants and found that exercise was a statistically significant way to help improve postpartum depression. A2024 studyfound that walking was an effective way to reduce depression and anxiety.\\n\\nCan’t fit in a long exercise session? Try working out for 10 minutes a few times during the day.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 2. Maintain a healthy diet\\n\\nHealthy eating alone won’t cure PPD. Still, getting into the habit of eating nutritious foods can help you feel better and give your body the nutrients you need.\\n\\nTry planning the week’s meals on the weekend and even preparing healthy snacks ahead of time. Think whole foods that are easy to grab on the go, such as chopped carrots and cubed cheese or apple slices and peanut butter.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 3. Create time for yourself\\n\\nYou may feel stuck on the couch breastfeeding. Maybe you’re feeling overwhelmed by work, household responsibilities, or your older children. Instead of managing these stresses alone, reach out for help. Take up your mother-in-law on her offer of free babysitting. Let your partner or another trusted adult take the baby for an hour or 2.\\n\\nYou may find it helpful to schedule some dedicated “me time” once a week. Even if you can only get out of the house between nursing sessions, you can use this time to decompress. Go on a walk, take a nap, go to a movie, or do some yoga and meditation.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 4. Make time to rest\\n\\nYou’ve probably been told to “sleep when the baby sleeps.” This advice may get annoying after a while, but it’s rooted in science. A2023 survey studyof 1,409 postpartum women found that of these women, those with higher levels of fatigue, poor sleep quality, and low resilience levels were at the greatest risk of developing PPD.\\n\\nIn the early days, your baby likely isn’t sleeping through the night. You may find it helpful to take naps or go to bed early. If you’re breastfeeding, consider pumping a bottle so your partner can take care of an overnight feeding or two.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 5. Focus on fish oils\\n\\nNow is also a good time to beef up your intake of fatty acids.In a2019 Japanese study, researchers found that women with higher fish consumption and higher n-3 PUFA intake had a reduced risk of postpartum depression 6months after delivery.\\n\\nSeafood is an excellent dietary source of fatty acids. If you’re a vegetarian, flaxseed oil is another great source. You can also find supplements at your local grocery store.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 6. Examine your breastfeeding\\n\\nA  suggests that breastfeeding may reduce your risk of developing PPD. In this study, researchers found that breastfeeding was associated with a 14% lower risk risk of PPD.\\n\\nThat being said, there are some cases where women develop depression symptoms while nursing. This condition is calledDysmorphic Milk Ejection Reflex, or D-MER. With D-MER, you might experience sudden feelings of sadness, agitation, or anger that last several minutes after your milk lets down.\\n\\nIn the end, choose the feeding method that feels right to you.\\n\\n\\n\\n## 7. Resist isolation\\n\\nThe days may blend together, making you feel isolated at times. Astudy from 2022suggests that getting support from other new moms may help relieve some symptoms of PPD. Researchers found that new moms who received peer support even once a week for 3 months reported improvements in their PPD symptoms.\\n\\nLearn more aboutnatural remedies that may help relieve symptoms of postpartum depression.\\n\\n\\n\\n## When to see your doctor\\n\\nAlthough many women experience the “baby blues” in the first several weeks following delivery, PPD is marked by deeper and longer-lasting feelings of sadness and agitation. These feelings can get worse and become chronic depression without medical help.\\n\\nIt’s a good idea to make an appointment with your doctor if you notice feelings of depression after birth, especially if they don’t fade after a couple of weeks or get worse with time. Few women ever seek treatment for their symptoms, despite the importance of treatment. Your doctor can point you in the right direction to get the support you need.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Traditional treatments\\n\\nPsychotherapy is the treatment of choice for PPD. It involves speaking with a mental health professional about your thoughts and feelings. In your sessions, you can work on ways to cope and solve problems. You can also set goals and find ways to deal with different situations so that you feel better and more in control.\\n\\nIn more severe cases, your doctor may also suggest antidepressants. These medications may enter your breast milk but are generally considered safe for women who breastfeed. If you have any concerns about this, speak with your doctor. They can help you weigh the potential benefits and risks.\\n\\n\\n\\n## Developing a support network\\n\\nYou may find comfort in confiding in a close friend or family member. If you don’t want to share your feelings with people you know, there are other places you can turn to for support.\\n\\nYou can:\\n\\n- Call your OB-GYN, midwife, or another healthcare professional.\\n- If you participate in a faith community, speak with a leader.\\n- Find a nearby support group for parents with PPD.\\n- Join an online forum or group for parents with PPD likePostpartum Progress.\\n- Call the anonymous PSI postpartum depression hotline at 800-944-4773.\\n\\n\\n## Outlook\\n\\nPPD is treatable. Many women see their symptoms improve within 6 months.\\n\\nCall your doctor immediately if you feel disoriented or confused, have obsessive thoughts about your baby, feel paranoid, or experience hallucinations. These are signs of a more severe condition called postpartum psychosis.\\n\\nIf you’re having thoughts of suicide or thoughts about harming your baby, call your local emergency services.\\n\\nLearn more aboutmen who experience postpartum depression.\\n\\n'"
